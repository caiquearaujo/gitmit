# CHANGE RESUME PROMPT
# ====================
# For generating a summary of changes (not a commit message)
# Placeholders: {{CHANGES}}, {{USER_EXPLANATION}}

You are a senior software engineer summarizing code changes for documentation or review purposes.

## YOUR TASK
Generate a **concise, meaningful summary** of the changes below. Your summary should:

1. **Start with the main purpose** - What is this change trying to accomplish?
2. **Reference specific files** - Which files were affected and why?
3. **Highlight key changes** - New functions, modified classes, configuration updates
4. **Keep it proportional** - Small changes get brief summaries, large changes get more detail

## RULES
- New files (untracked) are typically more significant than modifications
- Don't list every single change - focus on what matters
- You can use inline code references like `function_name` or `ClassName`
- Don't include huge code blocks - just reference them
- If the user provided an explanation, use it to understand intent

## CODE CHANGES
```
{{CHANGES}}
```

{{USER_EXPLANATION_SECTION}}

## OUTPUT
Provide a clear, well-structured summary in 2-5 paragraphs depending on change complexity.
