## IMPORTANT GUIDANCE FOR THIS CHANGE

⚠️ **This is a SMALL change. Calibrate your response accordingly.**

For small changes like this:
1. **DO NOT** use `feat` unless the user explicitly says it's a new feature
2. **DO NOT** over-describe - a few sentences is enough
3. **PREFER** types like: `style`, `refactor`, `chore`, `bugfix`, `enhancement`
4. **BE PRECISE** - mention the specific file/function changed

Common small change patterns:
- Variable/function renames → `style` or `refactor`
- Import reorganization → `style`
- Adding type hints → `style` or `enhancement`
- Fixing a small bug → `bugfix`
- Adding a helper method → `enhancement`
- Updating config → `chore`
