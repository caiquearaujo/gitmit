## GUIDANCE FOR MEDIUM-SIZED CHANGES

This is a **MEDIUM-sized change**. Consider the following:

1. **Evaluate the nature** of the change carefully:
   - Is this genuinely new functionality? → `feat`
   - Is this improving existing code? → `enhancement` or `refactor`
   - Is this restructuring without behavior change? → `refactor`
   - Is this fixing issues? → `bugfix`

2. **The description should**:
   - Mention key files/modules affected
   - Explain the purpose of the change
   - Reference specific functions/classes if significant

3. **User explanation priority**:
   - If the user says what this is, trust them
   - Use their words in your description
   - Match their categorization intent
